# Dicee ðŸŽ²

## What did I create

A dice app using which you can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to play ludo without the need of an actual dice.

## What you I learn

- How to use Flutter stateless widgets to design and update the user interface.
- How to use setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
